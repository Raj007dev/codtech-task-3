Overview of the Penetration Testing Toolkit (pentest_toolkit.py)
​This Python script is designed as a foundational, modular command-line utility for basic network penetration testing and security assessment tasks. It leverages standard Python libraries for network communication and concurrency.
​I. Architecture and Modularity
​The script is built around the argparse module, which defines two distinct, runnable submodules, allowing the user to select the desired function from the command line:
​scan: The Port Scanner Module.
​brute: The Simple Brute-Force Concept Module.
​II. Key Module Breakdown
​1. Port Scanner Module (scan)
​This module is designed for rapid identification of open TCP ports on a target host.
2. Simple Brute-Force Concept Module (brute)
​This module demonstrates the algorithmic logic required for a dictionary or brute-force attack, focusing on iteration and sequence generation.
III. Core Functions and Utilities
​worker(target, port_queue, open_ports): The function executed by each thread in the port scanner, responsible for popping a port from the queue and checking its status.
​run_port_scanner(target_ip, start_port, end_port): Manages the overall port scanning process, including thread creation and waiting for completion.
​generate_passwords(characters, max_length): A Python generator that yields password candidates, ensuring memory efficiency by producing one password at a time.
​main(): The entry point of the script, responsible for command-line argument parsing and delegating execution to the selected module.
